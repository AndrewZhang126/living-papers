# living-papers-testbed

Testbed for Living Papers development

- Experiment with WebComponents &amp; Lit as infrastructure.
- Experiment using Observable as the sole reactive runtime.

## Instructions

- Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
- Run `npm run serve` to launch development server and view test examples.
- Run `npm run build` to produce an output bundle.

There are no formal test cases at this time (despite the boilerplate inherited from the Lit starter kit).
