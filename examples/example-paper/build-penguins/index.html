Males and females of the same species can have different traits related to their role within an ecosystem. This is known as
ecological sexual dimorphism. In this paper <span class="cite-list">[<cite-ref key="doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0090081" index="1"></cite-ref>]</span>, the authors seeks to explore ecological sexual dimorphism among species of <em>Pygoscelis</em> penguins. They examine if foraging niche are more pronounced in sexually dimorphic species by collecting data from chinstrap, Adelie, and gentoo penguins.

Highlight each species, which seems to each have positive correlation (longer culmens have longer depth).
However, overall data is negatively correlated.</p><p>Here we can look at <a data-attr="11" class="action">Adelie</a>, <a data-attr="12" class="action">Chinstrap</a>, and <a data-attr="13" class="action">Gentoo</a> penguins again. Each species individually looks positively correlated. But again, the <a data-attr="14" class="action">overall data</a> is negatively correlated.</p><divi-viz data-attr="15"><cell-view data-cell="13"></cell-view></divi-viz><h1 id="conclusion" data-counter="4">Conclusion</h1><p>Chinstraps were found to be the most sexually size dimorphic, followed by gentoos. The paper also found that male chinstraps and gentoos were also enriched with certain isotopic nitrogen relative to females, thus revealing a foraging niche.</p><h1 nonumber="true">References</h1><ol class="references"><li id="ref-0">Gorman, K.
